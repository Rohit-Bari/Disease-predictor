🩺 Disease Detector

📌 Overview

The Disease Detector is a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning for health-related datasets Training ML models for disease prediction Model evaluation with accuracy and metrics Exporting trained model for reuse Easy-to-use interface via Jupyter Notebook

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x NumPy, Pandas → Data handling Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization Joblib → Model persistence
